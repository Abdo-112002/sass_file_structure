# sass_file_structure

This is the infrastructure that I use in my web design projects, it's my file structure and it's based on the sass language and is divided into some files..
1) sass file contains
+ Folder abstracts: contains the functions, mixin and variables file

+ Folder base: contains the basic style file and the heper classes

+ folder components : Contains all the components common to each page

+ Layout folder: It contains all the sections shared between the other pages

+ Pages folder: It is the main folder that contains the style of each page itself.
